<h1 style="text-align:center">Reddit Poster</h1>

Reddit poster is an application that allows you to post your advertisements to multiple subreddits at once. It is a
simple application that uses the Reddit API to post your ads. It is written in Python and uses the Tkinter library for
the GUI.

If you experience any issues with the application, or If your antivirus software flags the application, 
please contact me on discord at ricostryker. I will help you resolve the issue and make that the antivirus whitelists
the application in the future.
